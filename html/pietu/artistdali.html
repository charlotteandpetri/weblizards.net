These qualities describe the Spanish artist, Salvador Dali.  His ingenious talent, layered with virtuosity and technical  brilliance, was rivaled only by his unforgettable personality. Throughout his long career, Dali tirelessly explored new  media and theories. He painted, sculpted, created jewelry,  designed sets and costumes for ballets and films, wrote  books, created prints and delved into molecular biology and  nuclear physics. At the time of his death in 1989, he ranked with his fellow  Spaniard, Pablo Picasso as one of the two most influential  figures in modern art. --><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000"
