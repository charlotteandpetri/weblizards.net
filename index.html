        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p> Web Lizards, LLC was founded by a couple of tech &amp; market savvy college students before the turn of the last century. Our founding principle was to help people and enterprises to connect, promote, and operate on the web. </p>
        <p> We started a joint venture with a leading European mobile value-added service provider, Wap Oneline, Ltd., and our management team founded Wap Oneline USA, LLC. We expanded throughout North and South America, where we were pioneers in the fields of mobile messaging and marketing services. </p>
        <p> Recently, with a growing need for mobile apps, we started on yet another venture utilizing our great industry connections and broad understanding of mobile ecosystems, along with our coding and design expertise, to help people and enterprises to connect, promote, and operate using mobile apps. Deja Vu from the dot-com era.</p>
