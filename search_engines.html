      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Advertising your 
        web site can seem quite daunting to the inexperienced. Not because it 
        is necessarily difficult, but because a mistake can have significant and 
        detrimental consequences. It is also very time consuming, especially when 
        talking about registering the web site to the search engines on the web.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">First, try to identify 
        your customers. Who are they, where are </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">they 
        and what are they interested in. This of course is a huge </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">topic 
        that entire industries are devoted to answering. Find out who they are,</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
        then target this </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">group 
        as closely as possible. Every ad that is seen by someone </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">outside 
        of this target audience is a waste of your money.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Secondly, try to get 
        someone that enjoys sales </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">and 
        marketing involved with your operation. Companies</font> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">are 
        usually specialists in a particular field. They are great designers,</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> 
        software developers, wine merchants etc., but not necessarily </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">good 
        promoters. If you don't enjoy it not only will you likely be </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">bad 
        at it, but you will also waste a lot of the time you could </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">otherwise 
        devote to the things that you are good at.</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> Whether finding sales 
        and marketing help is possible or not, it </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">is 
        still important to have a good grasp of what is going on. </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Advertising 
        can often be the single biggest expense you have. You </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">need 
        to know where the money is going.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"> If you have a limited 
        advertising budget, spending it all on an ad campaign that fails to produce 
        results can easily and often does put many companies out of business.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Search engine registration 
        is crucial because it is the best way to attract new visitors even if 
        you have a lot money to spend on a national or global advertising campaign. 
        It is the best way because generally people who are on the Internet are 
        searching for something. Internet hasn’t quite taken TV’s place as a leisure 
        entertainment media yet. So, when they are searching for something that 
        your company does or sells your web site should pop-up in the search. 
        </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Search engines can 
        also be considered as an aid to find something you saw on TV, but can't 
        quite remember what was the name of the company or the new product they 
        are selling. (Taken that this company you are looking for, exist on the 
        internet)<br>

        <br>
        Well. It is easy to say it should pop-up in the search, but it is not 
        that easy to implement. There are many factors that make some sites rank 
        higher than others:</font></p>
      <p> </p>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">One thing that 
          we can affect is how the site is designed and built. We know all the 
          tricks that search engines like in the website’s code in order to list 
          higher. </font></li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">The other thing 
          that can be affected is how to choose such item that will be embedded 
          into your web site’s code such as: search keywords , your web site’s 
          description, web site’s title which can be different from the site’s 
          domain name, and last but not least the domain name for you site. </font></li>
      </ul>

        <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#006600">Important Search 
        Engines </font></b></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">Your site has to be 
        registered on most of the main search engines on the web. These are search 
        sites like: <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo.com</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.excite.com" target="_blank">Excite.com</a>, <a href="http://www.hotbot.com" target="_blank">HotBot.com</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.go.com" target="_blank">Go.com</a> (formerly <a href="http://www.infoseek.com" target="_blank">InfoSeek.com</a>), 
        <a href="http://www.webcrawler.com" target="_blank">WebCrawler.com</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.aol.com" target="_blank">Aol.com</a>, <a href="http://www.lycos.com" target="_blank">Lycos.com</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.altavista.com" target="_blank">Altavista.com</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.looksmart.com" target="_blank">LookSmart.com</a>, 
        <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google.com</a>. There 
        are also some Not-Free-Search-Engines like <a href="http://www.goto.com" target="_blank">GoTo.com</a>. 
        These are currently the TOP search engines that most people <b>use</b>. 
        Some of them also provide you a premium (faster) registration service 
        for an additional fee (for example Excite and LookSmart + MSN, TimeWarner 
        and CNN, all combined for $199.00). </font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">This 
        list changes constantly and we always list your site on the current TOP 
        search engines. However, we only list your site once initially, unless 
        you have ordered additional processing. <br>
        <br>
        When your site is finished we will register it to the TOP 10 search engines 
        as a part of the package but that is not enough to really drive a lot 
        of traffic to your site. Sites should be re-registered at least bimonthly 
        to really receive good results. Even then it takes months until you can 
        really see any significant difference in unique visitor numbers. Biggest 
        reason for this 'delay' is that it takes a long time (4 -10 weeks) for 
        the search engines to list your site in their database. Premium registration 
        could help with this problem. Another reason why it seems that your site 
        cannot compete against the other site's position in search results could 
        be that the other site has been on the web for couple of years already. 
        Web sites seem to build a certain maturity when it comes to search engines 
        (if the site has been actively registered for a longer time) and that 
        shows as a better positioning on the search results.<br>

      <p> <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">We will do the initial registration

        of options:</font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. We will do additional registering 
        into the TOP 10 search engines for an additional $300.00/session. </font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. We will do premium registration

        registering on Excite and LookSmart + MSN, TimeWarner and CNN, as well 
        as initial listing on Goto.com (requires your credit card since goto.com

        card).</font></font></p>
      <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3">3. You can go to these

        There is a Submit a site or Add Url link on the page that will take you

        software available on the web that could be used to automate this registration

        drop your site totally from their database. </font></font></p>

        </b>Every now and then I hear somebody promising that they can list anybody's 
        site in the search engines so that it will come up on the first page on 
        the search. Well, that is a sales lie. Nobody can guarantee anything with 
        these search engines, unfortunately. They can change all their criterias 
        or drop every site that has blue background if they wish. Well, fortunately 
        the latter is not what they are in business for. They are in business 
        to list everybody's site in a easily searchable search engine. They want 
        to keep their search engine as functional and objective to searches as 
        possible, which is why they hate registerings done by software for example.</font></p>
